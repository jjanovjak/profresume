    <h1>About Joe</h1>
    <p>I live each day with a large dose of wonder, curiosity and a twisted sense humor.  I am a life long learner and a life long educator.  Over twenty years of experience in field of IT systems administration 
        I have engaged in installing, configuring, troubleshooting and supporting computer systems and networking components.  I have consistently helped 
        keep enterprises online and running smoothly.  I have supported end users allowing them to perform their jobs without being hindered by IT 
        interference or glitches.  I am now honing my web development chops.</p>
